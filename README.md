# PRODIGY_DS_01

## Introduction
Welcome to my submission for Task 1 of the Data Science Internship at Prodigy Info Tech. In this task, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset focusing on visualizing the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized for this analysis is the **World Population Dataset**, which comprises population records from the year 2001 to 2022. It provides insights into global demographics over time.

### Series Code and Descriptions
- **SP.POP.TOTL**: Total population
- **SP.POP.TOTL.FE.IN**: Population of females
- **SP.POP.TOTL.MA.IN**: Population of males
- **SP.POP.TOTL.FE.ZS**: Percentage of females in total population
- **SP.POP.TOTL.MA.ZS**: Percentage of males in total population

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

## Task Overview
In this task, the goal was to create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During the EDA process, I performed the following tasks:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Evaluated the dataset for missing values, duplicates, and outliers, addressing these issues as needed.
2. **Visualization**: Developed bar charts and stacked charts to effectively illustrate the distribution of selected categorical or continuous variables.

## Conclusion
The EDA process yielded valuable insights into the distribution of the chosen variables within the dataset. This foundational analysis is essential for guiding subsequent exploration and modeling tasks in the data science workflow.

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission!
